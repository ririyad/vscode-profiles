# vscode-profiles


_Disclaimer: Visual Studio Code is my current default editor and recently with the v1.75 comes with profile switching option. And I think it's a really good deal as it brings the opportunity to use VSCode for different purposes. Along with code mining, I use to write in my blog and when I am in my non-coding writing mode, I prefer a more distraction free interface. VSCode just made is easy._

This repository contains settings for different profile I am actively using.
